Equation is merged with SpaceParser and gradient calculation. Renamed as Function for better understanding.

Added EulerSolver for motion processing (physics engine).

Goal and Ball are split in two classes each. GDX*name* extends *name* as I wanted to move as much GDX stuff as possible out of backend.

Added Vector2d for working with 2-dimensional vectors. Widely used throughtout all the backend.

Added PuttingCourse that stores all the information about the course and supports file I/O. 

Added GDXPuttingCourse that serves for visualisation of the course and derives PuttingCourse.

Added CrazyPutting and GDXCrazyPutting as templates for the core of the final product.

All API required is supported by now.

Carefully read the comments since many places require edits.

P.S.S.S. Will add javadoc as soon as possible.
