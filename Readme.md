To run the current software:

go to GameEngine2 

open the project with your IDE or type the following commands in your terminal/cmd


MacOS/Linux

gradle wrapper

./gradlew run


Windows

gradle wrapper

gradlew.bat run


Additionally, build.gradle supports 2 more customized tasks:

./gradlew run2d (2d visualization of the engine process)

./gradlew runSoftware (alternative for default 'run')


On Windows, just like in the previous example, type gradlew.bat instead of ./gradlew
